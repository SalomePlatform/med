test_qttesting.py
=================

Tests based on QtTesting framework from ParaView.
Main entry point is test_qttesting.py.
Each scenario is described in a XML file and can be recorded directly in the GUI via the "Record test" button. 

A scneario must save a final screenshot of the ParaView view in a file located in the temp directory (TODO: review
this). This file is compared against a baseline saved in the baselines subdirectory.
